# Comparison-of-Iterative-Methods-for-a-System-of-Linear-Equations
This project explores and compares three classical iterative methods:
- Jacobi Method
- Gauss-Seidel Method
- Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Method

The goal is to solve systems of linear equations and analyze the number of iterations, error reduction, and time taken by each method.
